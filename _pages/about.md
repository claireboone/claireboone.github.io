I am a PhD candidate in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I also have an MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from UC Berkeley, and a BA & Sc from McGill University in Economics and Biology.

My research focuses on using behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery. I am particularily interested in applying quasi-experimental econometric techniques to medical and health data to better understand clinical decision-making.

Much of medicine exists in a 'grey area' where clinical decisions are not clear cut. I investigate one of these situations in my job market paper: diagnosing and treating hypertension, a highly prevalent disease where false positves are common. I use bunching estimation to show that providers round some patients' blood pressure down, turning a positve test result into a negative. This behavior is beneficial to patients, who are less likley to be hospitlaized for stroke or heart attack at clinics with high bunching. 

I am on the 2021-2022 job market.

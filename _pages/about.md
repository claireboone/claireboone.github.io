I am a PhD candidate in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/) at the University of California, Berkeley and on the 2021-2022 job market. My research interests are in health economics and policy, and behavioral economics.

My dissertation focuses on using behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery. In my job market paper, I investigate the role of discretion and the use of heuristics in clinical decision-making. I also study the supply- and demand-side effects of nudging high-risk patients at scale.

Before my PhD I earned an MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from UC Berkeley, and a BA & Sc from McGill University in Economics and Biology.

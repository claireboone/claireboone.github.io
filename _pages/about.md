<meta name="description" content="Claire Boone, PhD Candidate in Health Economics at UC Berkeley.">

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago, affiliated with the [Center for Health and the Social Sciences](https://chess.uchicago.edu/), and the [Center for Applied AI](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence). I am also a research scientist in the Health Research Accelerator group at [Providence](https://research.providence.org/). 

My research uses behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery, with a focus on healthcare provider decision-making. 

I earned my PhD from UC Berkeley in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/) in 2022.

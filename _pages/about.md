<meta name="description" content="Claire Boone, PhD Candidate in Health Economics at UC Berkeley.">

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, affiliated with the [Center for Applied AI](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence) and the [Center for Health and the Social Sciences](https://chess.uchicago.edu/). I am also a research scientist in the Health Research Accelerator group at [Providence](https://research.providence.org/) where I lead randomized evaluations of novel health care technologies.

In fall 2024 I'll join McGill University as an assistant professor in the department of Economics, and the department of Equity, Ethics, and Policy in the school of Medicine. 

My research uses behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery, with a focus on healthcare provider decision-making. 

I earned my PhD from UC Berkeley in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/) in 2022.

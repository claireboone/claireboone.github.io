I am a PhD candidate in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I also have an MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from UC Berkeley, and a BA & Sc from McGill University in Economics and Biology.

My research focuses on using behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery.

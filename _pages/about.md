<meta name="description" content="Claire Boone, PhD Candidate in Health Economics at UC Berkeley.">

I am an assistant professor at McGill University joint between the department of Economics and the department of Equity, Ethics, and Policy in the faculty of Medicine. 

Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a research scientist in the Health Research Accelerator group at [Providence](https://research.providence.org/). I earned my PhD from UC Berkeley in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/).

My research uses behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery, with a focus on healthcare provider decision-making.

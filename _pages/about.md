<meta name="description" content="Claire Boone, PhD Candidate in Health Economics at UC Berkeley.">

I am an assistant professor at McGill University joint between the department of [Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) and the [department of Equity, Ethics, and Policy](https://www.mcgill.ca/equity-ethics-policy/about) in the faculty of Medicine. 

Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business Center for Applied AI](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/research) and a research scientist in the Health Research Accelerator group at [Providence](https://research.providence.org/). I earned my PhD from UC Berkeley in [Health Policy, Health Economics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/health-policy-and-management/health-policy-phd/).

My research uses behavioral economics to understand and improve health services delivery, with a focus on healthcare provider decision-making.

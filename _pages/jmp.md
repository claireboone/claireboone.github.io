<p>Many clinical decisions must be made with poor or limited information. In these cases, discretionary decision-making – an understudied input to quality healthcare – is highly important. I study how providers behave when diagnosing and treating hypertension, a potentially deadly disease where false positive test results are common. I find that providers round some patients' test results below the diagnostic threshold, using their discretion to turn a positive test for hypertension into a negative. Using bunching estimation to quantify this behavior at the clinic level, I estimate that up to 62% of patients expected to be just above the diagnostic threshold are instead just below it. Thresholds are widely used in medicine, yet their potentially distortional effects on provider behavior have not been previously quantified. Using the fact that in Chile patients are assigned a public primary care clinic based on their home address, I examine the impact of this clinical discretion with data from >600,000 visits. Providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines similarly across clinics. Yet, at high discretion clinics, patients who are assigned a negative test result are 9-44% less likely to be hospitalized for heart attack or stroke within 1 year. These results indicate provider discretion leads to better sorting of patients with respect to the diagnostic threshold. This appears to be partly achieved using heuristics: among patients with identical test results, those with characteristics representative of high cardiovascular risk are less likely to be sorted below the diagnostic threshold. I conclude that in a setting with poor information, heuristic thinking can be beneficial to clinical decision-making.</p>

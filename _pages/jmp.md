## Discretion in Clinical Decision-Making 

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<small> 
<p> Out of necessity, medical decisions are often made with limited information. In these cases, discretionary decision-making is highly important and rules of thumb might be useful. I study how providers behave when diagnosing and treating hypertension, a potentially deadly disease where false positive test results are common. Using bunching estimation, I find systematic manipulation of blood pressure just below the diagnostic threshold. This behavior varies widely across primary care clinics affecting 0-62% of patients expected just above the threshold who are instead recorded just below it. Comparing high and low bunching clinics reveals that providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines similarly, conditional on recorded blood pressure. Yet, patients exposed to high manipulation are significantly less likely to be hospitalized with stroke or heart attack within a year. In making discretionary diagnoses providers appear to rely on heuristics, sorting patients without characteristics representative of high cardiovascular risk below the threshold. I argue that in the case of limited information, heuristic thinking and discretionary diagnosis lead to better patient outcomes. </p>

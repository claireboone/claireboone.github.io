## Discretion in Clinical Decision-Making 

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<small> 
<p> Out of necessity, medical decisions are often made with limited information. Antibiotics must be prescribed before lab results come back, invasive heart attack tests must be decided on, and true positives must be distinguished from false positives. In these cases, discretionary decision-making is highly important and mental shortcuts like heuristics might be useful. I study how providers behave when diagnosing and treating hypertension, a potentially deadly disease where false positive test results are common. Using bunching estimation and data from >600,000 patient-visits, I find that some patientsâ€™ blood pressure is rounded down below the diagnostic threshold, indicating providers believed these were false positives. This behavior varies widely at the primary care clinic level: in the 247 clinics studied, between 0 and 62% of patients expected just above the threshold are instead observed just below. Comparing high and low bunching clinics reveals that providers adhere to clinical practice guidelines similarly. Yet, patients at high bunching clinics are significantly less likely to be hospitalized with stroke or heart attack within a year. These results suggest the use of clinical discretion leads to better diagnostic sorting of patients. How is this sorting achieved? The representativeness heuristics explains some of this behavior: patients without characteristics of high cardiovascular risk are more likely to be considered false positives. In contrast to when heuristic thinking reduces relevant information, in the case of a noisy or limited medical signal decision-making influenced by heuristics and discretion can fill gaps in clinical practice guidelines. </p>

<p>Missed clinic appointments or no-shows burden health care systems through inefficient use of staff time and resources. Scheduling software combined with automatically sent appointment reminders shows promise to improve clinics’ management through timely cancellations and re-scheduling, but at-scale evidence is missing. We study a nationwide text message appointment reminder program in Chile implemented at primary care clinics for patients with chronic disease. Using longitudinal clinic-level data, we find that the program did not change the number of visits by chronic patients eligible to receive the reminder, but visits from other patients ineligible to receive reminders increased by 5.0% in the first year and 7.4% in the second. Clinics treating more chronic patients and those with a relatively younger patient population benefited more from the program. Scheduling systems combined with automatic appointment reminders were effective in increasing clinics’ ability to care for more patients, likely due to timely cancellations and re-scheduling.</p>

<p><u>Background:</u> Attending clinic appointments as scheduled is crucial for patients living with chronic diseases as they receive screenings, prescriptions, and information from healthcare providers. Yet, appointment adherence remains low. Most common reasons for missing appointments include forgetting or confusing the date, time, or location of the appointment; making Short Message Service (SMS) appointment reminders a promising tool to improve chronic care. Small pilot studies have shown the efficacy of reminders short-term, but evidence on how their usage at-scale and long-term is missing. We evaluate short and long-term effects of SMS appointment reminders sent at scale on the management of chronic disease.</p>    

<p><u>Methods:</u> We study a program adopted nationwide in Chile that through the electronic health record system automatically sends SMS appointment reminders to patients diagnosed with diabetes (T2DM) and/or hypertension. This program began in 2015 and was phased in across clinics over several years; allowing us to use a difference-in-differences approach. We first study the impact of SMS reminders on patients’ retention in primary care and the tests and treatment received at primary care visits. We also study medication adherence, hospitalizations, and in-hospital mortality, and conduct heterogeneity analyses by diagnosis (hypertension vs. T2DM). </p>   

<p><u>Data:</u> We use a unique panel dataset containing electronic health records from over 300,000 patients with chronic disease, 67% of whom attended clinics that implemented the SMS program by 2018. These data are linked at the patient level to medication withdrawals and hospitalizations, all observed from 2013-2018. We also match clinics by municipality to Chile’s 2015 National Socioeconomic Survey to obtain a rich set of municipality-level controls.  </p>  
  
<p><u>Results:</u> SMS reminders improved use of primary care: patients with T2DM and hypertension were 3.9% and 7.6% more likely to attend a primary care visit each semester, respectively, than patients who did not receive reminders. This resulted in more frequent health monitoring: among patients with T2DM semesterly measurement of blood glucose and weight increased by 5.6% and 3.7% respectively. Patients who received SMS reminders had significantly higher medication adherence. They were also more likely to experience cardiovascular-related hospitalization - 36.1% for patients with T2DM and 18.7% for patients with hypertension - but less likely to die in-hospital, suggesting increased hospital use through referrals or hospitalization when relatively healthier compared to patients who did not receive reminders 

<p><u>Conclusion:</u> Our findings suggest that when implemented at scale SMS reminders show promise in improving chronic care and health; particularly for those who may need it the most. We also provide evidence demonstrating that reducing patient drop-out with a simple and low-cost nudge can have meaningful positive effects on health-seeking behavior. This is likely to be particularly true in a setting where attendance at primary care determines availability of any subsequent care such as prescriptions, tests, and specialist visits.</p>

<u>How Can Quality of Healthcare Be Assessed in the 21st Century?</u>

<small>
<p><u>Background:</u> As governments commit to universal access to high quality care, questions related to improving quality are eclipsed by questions on how to define and measure quality. We draw from Donabedian’s conceptual framework, which categorizes quality of care dimensions into measurements of structures, processes, and outcomes, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of a randomized, at-scale quality of care improvement program for Kenya’s private sector.</p><br/>
 <br/> 
<u>Methods:</u> Across a sample of N=232 clinics, we collected comprehensive quality of care data using N=1195 standardized patient visits – the state-of-the-art method to assess provider practice, N=322 provider surveys with vignettes to measure knowledge, patient exit interviews, and household and clinic surveys. We use these data to examine a program’s effects on three quality of care dimensions: structures (e.g. sources), processes (e.g. diagnostic and treatment actions), and outcomes (e.g. client experience). <br/>
  <br/>
<u>Results:</u> We found the program improved structures, but these improvements did not translate into better process quality. The program reduced correct care by 12% (p-value<0.05), but standardized patients, real clients, and households did not recognize any changes in quality due to the program. In our study setting where highly competent and well-stocked private providers gave lower quality of care, the Donabedian framework appeared comprehensive, but failed to pinpoint the drivers of process quality. By simultaneously examining structures, processes, and outcomes with multiple measurement methods, we conclude that a new quality of care framework is needed that accounts for market dynamics, accountability of providers, altruistic preferences of providers, effective targeting for the poor and marginalized, and ongoing quality monitoring.</p>

<u>The Impact of AHME on Pro-Poor Healthcare</u>   
<small> With Joshua Gruber, Paul Gertler, and Ada Kwan. [AHME RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/217)</small><br/>

<p>Increasing use of the private health sector has been suggested as a method to reduce healthcare inequity in Sub-Saharan Africa, where populations with the most need seek the least care. We study the simultaneous supply and demand-side effects of AHME, a management intervention that aimed to improve the quality and accessibility of private-sector clinics in Kenya. AHME focused on access to public health insurance, where the government is the payer, as a mechanism to increase use of affordable, high-quality private care for poor individuals. The program was successful in increasing the share of clinics accepting national insurance, the share of households enrolled in national health insurance, and in turn the share of clinics' clients from lower wealth quintiles. Efforts to reduce the cost of care must also ensure that the quality of care is maintained. We use standardized patient (SP) experiments to measure overall quality, and quality of care for SPs who present as poor. SPs presented as poor by telling the provider they could only afford KSH 300 in fees. We find that when faced with a client with a budget constraint, providers reduced the quantity of both necessary and unnecessary care, resulting in lower quality of care for 'poor' clients. While public insurance is a promising mechanism to connect low-income households to private care, more work must be done to ensure clients of all wealth levels receive high quality care.</p>

<u>Do private providers give patients what they demand, even if it's unnecessary? A standardized patient experiment in Kenya</u> <br/>

<u>Background:</u> Low and varied quality of care has been demonstrated for childhood illnesses in low- and middle-income country settings. Some quality improvement strategies focus on increasing patient engagement; however, evidence suggests that patients demanding medicines can favor the selection of resistant microbial strains in the individual and the community if drugs are inappropriately used. Antibiotics, and the consequences of their overuse, has been at the forefront of Kenyan health policy and several public health campaigns, whereas consequences of misusing antiparasitic drugs receive less attention. This study examines the effects on quality of care when patients demand different types of unnecessary medicines. 
<br>  
<u>Methods:</u> We conduct an experiment where standardized patients (SPs), locally recruited individuals trained to simulate a standardized case scenario, present at private clinics demanding one of two unnecessary medicines. Between March 8 and May 28, 2019, 10 SPs portraying caretakers of a pre-scripted watery diarrhea childhood case scenario (in absentia) conducted N=200 successful SP-provider visits at 200 private, primary care clinics in Kenya. Half of the clinics were randomly assigned to receive an SP demanding amoxicillin (an antibiotic); the other half, an SP demanding albendazole (an antiparasitic drug often used for deworming), with all other presenting characteristics the same. We analyzed 200 visits with logistic and linear regression models to assess the effects of demanding different unnecessary medicines on correct and unnecessary quality of care outcomes.
<br> 
<u>Findings:</u> Demanding albendazole significantly increased its rate of dispensing to 35% (95% CI: 25-44) compared to 3% (95% CI: 0-7) among those who didn't demand it (adjusted odds ratio 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.23, p<0.001). The rate of dispensing amoxicillin did not significantly differ between those who demanded it and those who did not demand it (adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI: 0.50,5.98). Neither had an effect on any correct case management outcomes, such as treatment or referral elsewhere.
<br> 
<u>Interpretation:</u> Private providers appear to account for both business-driven benefits as well as individual health impacts when making prescribing decisions. Additional research is needed on provider`s knowledge and perceptions of the extent to which different unnecessary medicines can be harmful to distinguish why they make such prescribing decisions when patients demand specific incorrect care.

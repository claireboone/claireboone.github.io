<small> Missed clinic appointments or no-shows burden health care systems through inefficient use of staff time and resources. Scheduling software combined with automatically sent appointment reminders shows promise to improve clinics’ management through timely cancellations and re-scheduling, but at-scale evidence is missing. We study a nationwide text message appointment reminder program in Chile implemented at primary care clinics for patients with chronic disease. Using longitudinal clinic-level data, we find that the program did not change the number of visits by chronic patients eligible to receive the reminder, but visits from other patients ineligible to receive reminders increased by 5.0% in the first year and 7.4% in the second. Clinics treating more chronic patients and those with a relatively younger patient population benefited more from the program. Scheduling systems combined with automatic appointment reminders were effective in increasing clinics’ ability to care for more patients, likely due to timely cancellations and re-scheduling.

<u>The Role of Appointment Reminders in the Management of Chronic Disease</u> <br/>

<u>Background:</u> Attending clinic appointments as scheduled is crucial for patients living with chronic diseases as they receive screenings, prescriptions, and information from healthcare providers. Yet, appointment adherence remains low. Most common reasons for missing appointments include forgetting or confusing the date, time, or location of the appointment; making Short Message Service (SMS) appointment reminders a promising tool to improve chronic care. Small pilot studies have shown the efficacy of reminders short-term, but evidence on how their usage at-scale and long-term is missing. We evaluate short and long-term effects of SMS appointment reminders sent at scale on the management of chronic disease.  <br/>
<br/>  
<u>Methods:</u> We study a program adopted nationwide in Chile that through the electronic health record system automatically sends SMS appointment reminders to patients diagnosed with diabetes (T2DM) and/or hypertension. This program began in 2015 and was phased in across clinics over several years; allowing us to use a difference-in-differences approach. We first study the impact of SMS reminders on patients’ retention in primary care and the tests and treatment received at primary care visits. We also study medication adherence, hospitalizations, and in-hospital mortality, and conduct heterogeneity analyses by diagnosis (hypertension vs. T2DM). <br/>
<br/>  
<u>Data:</u> We use a unique panel dataset containing electronic health records from over 300,000 patients with chronic disease, 67% of whom attended clinics that implemented the SMS program by 2018. These data are linked at the patient level to medication withdrawals and hospitalizations, all observed from 2013-2018. We also match clinics by municipality to Chile’s 2015 National Socioeconomic Survey to obtain a rich set of municipality-level controls.  <br/>
<br/>  
<u>Results:</u> SMS reminders improved use of primary care: patients with T2DM and hypertension were 3.9% and 7.6% more likely to attend a primary care visit each semester, respectively, than patients who did not receive reminders. This resulted in more frequent health monitoring: among patients with T2DM semesterly measurement of blood glucose and weight increased by 5.6% and 3.7% respectively. Patients who received SMS reminders had significantly higher medication adherence. They were also more likely to experience cardiovascular-related hospitalization - 36.1% for patients with T2DM and 18.7% for patients with hypertension - but less likely to die in-hospital, suggesting increased hospital use through referrals or hospitalization when relatively healthier compared to patients who did not receive reminders.  <br/>
<br/>  
<u>Conclusion:</u> Our findings suggest that when implemented at scale SMS reminders show promise in improving chronic care and health; particularly for those who may need it the most. We also provide evidence demonstrating that reducing patient drop-out with a simple and low-cost nudge can have meaningful positive effects on health-seeking behavior. This is likely to be particularly true in a setting where attendance at primary care determines availability of any subsequent care such as prescriptions, tests, and specialist visits.

<u>How Can Quality of Healthcare Be Assessed in the 21st Century?</u>

<small>
As governments commit to universal access to high quality care, questions related to improving quality are eclipsed by questions on how to define and measure quality. We draw from Donabedian’s conceptual framework, which categorizes quality of care dimensions into measurements of structures, processes, and outcomes, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of a randomized, at-scale quality of care improvement program for Kenya’s private sector. <br/>
 <br/> 
Across a sample of N=232 clinics, we collected comprehensive quality of care data using N=1195 standardized patient visits – the state-of-the-art method to assess provider practice, N=322 provider surveys with vignettes to measure knowledge, patient exit interviews, and household and clinic surveys. We use these data to examine a program’s effects on three quality of care dimensions: structures (e.g. sources), processes (e.g. diagnostic and treatment actions), and outcomes (e.g. client experience). <br/>
  <br/>
We found the program improved structures, but these improvements did not translate into better process quality. The program reduced correct care by 12% (p-value<0.05), but standardized patients, real clients, and households did not recognize any changes in quality due to the program. In our study setting where highly competent and well-stocked private providers gave lower quality of care, the Donabedian framework appeared comprehensive, but failed to pinpoint the drivers of process quality. By simultaneously examining structures, processes, and outcomes with multiple measurement methods, we conclude that a new quality of care framework is needed that accounts for market dynamics, accountability of providers, altruistic preferences of providers, effective targeting for the poor and marginalized, and ongoing quality monitoring.
